<h1>Function of our Pokemon</h1>
<p>Initially we wanted to focus on css similar to when you are in any Pokemon game and access your pokedex. Starting off by identifying your region then being able to access the Pokemon you want to choose, upon selection it should refer to the description of what type and and image should load. However, that was the struggle of our work, being unable to find the url that has the image of each pokemon. As you see we load the region through our promises of specific regions and gather the Pokemons that make up that region itself, in order for that to happen, we need to make data structures that contained the Pokemonâ€™s name and then further pull deeper. Returning the names for each Pokemon and once being able to click on to that should link to another page that contains information of the Pokemon and grab the image of each one. Once again we were able to fully dive into that and were fetch the data of the names and the descriptions. Each time new data loads, we remove the previous data with new data and a new url. Within the url we make a promise for the click to access the data of description of the Pokemon itself The design of the css is basic but is clean and simple so it is easier to use and speaks the truth. The remove function clears the pokemon and description if clicked on region and after click on pokemon removes itself completely.</p>
